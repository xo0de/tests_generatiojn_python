Class Account

For security purposes, passwords from user accounts are stored in databases not in explicit form, but in the form of hash values - numbers calculated using a special algorithm based on passwords.

You have access to the hash_function() function, which takes a password as an argument and returns its hash value.

Implement the Account class, which describes an Internet user account on some service. When instantiated, the class must take two arguments in the following order:
    * login - user login
    * password â€” user password

The Account class must have two properties:

login is a read-only property that returns the user's login. When attempting to change a property, an AttributeError exception must be raised with the text:
    "Changing login is not possible"

password - is a read/write property that returns a hash value of the user account password. When changed, the property should calculate the hash value of the new password and store it, not the password itself

Note 1: Additional data verification for correctness is not required. It is guaranteed that the implemented class is used only with correct data.

Note 2: There are no restrictions regarding the implementation of the Account class; it can be arbitrary.

Note 3: Test data is available in the tests folder
